                <div class="col">hose interested in how data breaches occur should be familiar with
                    the general topography of
                    the
                    Internet. In our previous </div>

                <p class="offset-lg-1 p-0">piece, we discussed the difference between the surface web, deep web
                    and
                    dark web.
                    Most
                    estimates
                    about
                    the topography of the Internet conclude that the deep web makes up between 95%-99% of all web sites.
                    <br>
                    The dark web likely comprises less than 1%, while the surface web accounts for only a few percentage
                    points itself. Nearly the entire Internet is the deep web. In our history of examining data
                    breaches, we
                    have found that while much focus has been put on the criminal activity occurring in the dark web,
                    the
                    biggest cause of data exposure is when a system or dataset ostensibly in the deep web inadvertently
                    bubbles up to the surface.
                </p>

            </div>
            <h2 class="text-center">Data Leaks on the Dark Web</h2>

        </div>
        <p class="col-lg-5 mx-auto">Controversy and intrigue surrounds the dark web. Rightly so, as it is regularly used
            by
            criminals to
            disseminate stolen information. However, despite the presence of actual criminal activity on the
            dark
            web, the process of stolen corporate dataset ending up for sale there is long and complex, requiring
            malicious human actors with well above average technical know-how with access to a closed network of
            trusted individuals. Thus the bar for fencing data by this method is comparatively high, meaning the
            payout would have to be substantial to make the labor worthwhile.</p>

    </div>
    <div class=" col-lg-5 mx-auto justify-content-center pt-5">
        <img src="img/image6.svg" style="width:100%;"" alt="">

        </div>
        <div class=" col-lg-4 mx-auto pt-5 ">
            <p class=" ">Furthermore, data sold on the dark web has to first be obtained somewhere else.
            Aside
            from a
            small number
            of
            insider attacks, where someone who was purposefully granted access misuses it for personal gain or
            malicious
            intent, much of that data is gleaned through the surface and deep web. By the time it ends up for sale
            on
            the dark web, it has long since been exposed elsewhere. The mystery of the dark web, conjured simply by
            its
            name, can lure organizations into mis-prioritizing efforts there over places they would better be spent,
            namely, the deep web.</p>
            <h2 class=" text-center lg-5 pt-5">Indexing the Deep Web</h2>
        <p class="lg-5">But we know that the deep web isn't indexed by search engines, so how are deep web data
            leaks
            discoverable? Even though it's true that the deep web is defined as all that which isn’t indexed on
            the
            major search engines, the truth is that Google can be used to find documents, pages, and even entire
            systems thought to be restricted by their owners. Maybe technically, if they can be found, they
            don’t
            qualify as the deep web. But such a semantic argument is irrelevant to an organization facing a
            major
            data exposure due to a misunderstanding of how obscured their resources actually were.
            Various Google search techniques have been developed to make finding such assets much easier, thus
            surfacing them and exposing their contents. For example, including environment variables inside a
            web-server directory can lead to those files being indexed. This makes searching for them easy,
            finding
            common environment variables like database credentials easy to find for websites that are
            misconfigured
            in this way.
            But even for sites that can’t be reached via the major search engines, other methods exist to find
            vulnerable resources on the deep web. Just as Google and Bing were built to facilitate finding
            surface
            web resources, other indexes have been built to facilitate finding deep web resources. Some of these
            are
            as simple as a port scanner, randomly polling networks for active connections and documenting them
            in a
            database. Some powerful scanners like ZMAP can poll nearly the entire internet in hours. Other
            mechanisms catalog registered certificates by domain, capturing hostnames of systems otherwise
            unknown
            to the public. Many of these types of indices exist, and more are being built every day.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center lg-5 pt-5">Unauthorized Access vs. Unauthenticated Access</h2>
        <p class="lg-5">It’s important to point out the difference between anonymous access and unauthorized
            access.
            Authentication is the process of establishing one's identity. Authorization is the process of
            determining whether one has the permission to access a resource. All of the exposures that the
            UpGuard
            research team reports– that is, all data leaks– are available to anonymous access, meaning anyone
            regardless of their identity would be able to access that information. In cases where anonymous
            access
            is permitted, everyone is "authorized," in that the rules governing permission allow them access; or
            maybe more to the point, if there is no authentication layer, there can be no sorting of authorized
            versus unauthorized.
            Examples of deep web breaches include UpGuard’s discovery of Facebook user data on Amazon’s S3 cloud
            storage platform. We've previously written about this design flaw in S3's security model, but in
            summary, cloud storage is typically considered part of the deep web because it should require
            authentication to access; however, because cloud storage can be configured to be publicly
            accessible,
            many misconfigured storage instances expose sensitive data believed to be secure in the deep web.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-center lg-5 pt-5" id="fiftySevenMillion">57 million records</h1>
        <p class="lg-5">Another example is the exposure of 57 million records of PII for American citizens in a
            misconfigured
            ElasticSearch system. Elastic is a powerful data analysis platform, but can allow anonymous access
            if
            not configured properly. Such applications, including databases like MongoDB and file transfer
            protocols
            like rsync are typically considered part of the protected deep web infrastructure, but in many cases
            that protection is absent, and these systems are being indexed, scanned, and ultimately compromised.
            While data traded on the dark web may be gathered using unauthorized– that is, illegal– access, data
            leaks from the deep web occur due to a lack of authentication. The barrier to accessing this
            information
            is much, much lower. While unauthorized access requires breaking into a system, accessing
            unauthenticated data merely requires waiting for it to be opened to the world. And with the vast
            majority of all digital resources residing in the deep web, it is inevitable that some of them will
            be.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-center lg-5 pt-5">How To Prevent Deep Web Data Exposures</h2>
        <h3>Treat cybersecurity as business risk management</h3>
        <p class="lg-5">Where authentication falls short is in its administration. Creating and maintaining
            secured
            online
            resources, especially at large scale, is a complex task. The business realities of most companies
            often
            mean that IT departments are fighting for resources like everyone else, and that things that “would
            be
            nice” are deferred in lieu of items more relevant to the bottom line. Security has problematically
            become one of the things first put into this “would be nice” bucket, since it doesn’t actually
            provide
            direct functionality, and is thus seen as an additional cost to service. Because of this, the
            authentication security of many online resources is inconsistent, leading to the data breaches we’re
            all
            familiar with. These don’t occur because of the actions of malicious outsiders, but because of the
            internal processes of the organizations themselves.
            A multilayered approach to authentication and authorization can greatly reduce the risk of exposure.
            For
            example, requiring someone to be on a corporate VPN in order to reach a server that they then must
            log
            in to minimizes the footprint of the server itself, preventing the system from being detected and
            indexed from the wider internet, and still controlling authorization through user-based credentials,
            which can be held to best practices to stay more secure.
            Rather than being seen as an additional cost to the service provided by technology, security should
            instead be seen as a risk management technique, mitigating potential damage to the organization.
            Like
            all risk, it can seem intangible and far away when things are running smoothly, and larger than life
            when an incident has already occurred.</p>
        <h3>Evaluate and control third-party risk</h3>
        <p>But business technology is an ecosystem, and even if primary operations are squared away, when data
            processing is outsourced to a third party, the risk of exposure carries over to their systems and
            processes as well. Understanding and quantifying this third-party risk is key in preventing third
            party
            data breaches from undermining the security efforts of in-house IT staff and exposing the
            organization
            to just as much scrutiny and consequence as if the breach had been on a primary system-- it is the
            data
            that gets exposed-- where it lived at the time of exposure is immaterial to most people who trust an
            organization with such information.</p>
        <h3>Proactively monitor cybersecurity risk</h3>
        <p>Finally, the only way for an organization to be sure what their deep web profile looks like is to
            continuously check. Without proactive efforts to understand what assets are obscured, which require
            authentication, and whether sensitive data is actually available on the deep (or surface) web, there
            is
            no way to prepare for or defend against the potential issues that occur here. Furthermore, proactive
            efforts go a long way toward company good faith efforts in the event a breach does occur, paying off
            by
            both preventing breaches and showing customers they actually care. Like all risk, there is no
            complete
            mitigation of the risk taken on by the adoption of technology. But those who act proactively to
            minimize
            this risk stand a far better chance of navigating their business through the deep and the dark.
            The scale of the problem, as well as the ease of exposure is why UpGuard's BreachSight team has
            chosen

            <p class="pt-4">Ever since digital transformation began, the image of the hoodie-wearing hacker,
                skateboarding up to an
                access terminal in the middle of the night and running some code on a laptop reflected in their
                sunglasses has dominated the imagination of people considering cybersecurity. This analog to the
                material
                world, to crime and property, has some merit, or data wouldn’t be valuable. But it can be overstated
                to
                the point of obscuring the real threats to an online presence, the misunderstanding and
                mismanagement of
                deep web assets and data.
                Understanding the concepts of each layer of the internet, if not the technical details, can help
                remove
                some of the mystery around what are very practical cybersecurity issues surrounding online data.</p>
